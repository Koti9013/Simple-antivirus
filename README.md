# Simple-antivirus
This simple project can scan your task manager &amp; startup files, can find intruders and report them to you. It is also open source, so it guarantees you that it will not harm your computer.
 # How to use
 It's an often question to developers. The project is really easy in use, so thats how you start it:
 1. First, you must start it with administrator rights. Don't worry, the script need it only to work correct and to be able to deactivate the intruders' instruments that can really harm your PC.
 2. Then, wait for the script to start. It will automatically check the latest updates when you launch it.
 3. When the antivirus find some suspicious files it will automatically report you about it. Then it's up to you.
 4. The script will check autostarting tasks and read all about their path. If the task's home is a folder for short-timed files, then it will tell you about it. Don't worry, the system's files are ignored. It will also ignore such files as "OneDrive" etc., so it will not harm your PC
 5. You can tell it to delete it or skip the file and continue scanning. It's easy to use, I tried to do everything to optimizate it for you :)
